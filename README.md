# Introduction
This is a repository which contains my Hackintosh EFI config using OpenCore bootloader. It's specifically designed for my Dell XPS 15 7590 4K Touch laptop, however may work with other variations of Dell XPS 15 with some minor tweaks and adjustment. It supports MacOS Ventura 13.0 and can be upgraded OTA (System Preferences) from MacOS Monterey 12.0.1 to MacOS Ventura 13.0 (I replaced the outdated EFI with new EFI before updating); The current wireless card does support WLAN and Bluetooth, however AirDrop is not supported. MacOS gestures work fine. I don't know about the battery satistics though I can definitely take a look whenever I get the time. Hopefully this helps :)
